Problem code: DCEPC12G


Prime(n) is defined as  number of primes less than equal to N.

Totient(n) is defined as the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n.

F(N) = Prime(n) – Totient(n) 

and we don’t like negative values, so if F(n) < 0, consider it as 0.

G(n) = Totient(n) ^ (Factorial (F(N)))

 

You are given a number N. You have to output G(N) % 10^9+7.

Input

First line consists of T, the number of test cases.

Each of the next T lines contains one integer N.

Output

Output T lines each line containing the value of function G(N) % 10^9+7

Constraints

1<=T<=100

1<=N<=10000000

Example

Input:
1
2

Output:
1


Analysis:
========
generate primes and get euler totient and primes diff

we were asked to find the totient ^ (factorial(diff))

factorial(n) = 1 if n = 0
             = n * (n-1)  * (n-2) .... 1

it turns out max diff is 2, 
ie. fact(2) = 2
    fact(1) = 1
    so take care of diff when it is zero, i.e set it to 1 and that's it
