15256. Partition function (EASY)
Problem code: PARCARD1

You need to output the number of distinct ways of representing n as a sum of natural numbers (with order irrelevant) for all integer n from 0 to 10000 inclusive.

First numbers of output must be:

1 1 2 3 5 7 11 15 22 30 42 56 77

Analysis:
    Use euler equation: 
catch: calculating pentagonal number again and again, just precompute them, will solve easily
