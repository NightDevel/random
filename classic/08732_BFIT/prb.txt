SPOJ Problem Set (classical)

8732. Best Fit

Problem code: BFIT



You are given a sequence of N random values (s1, s2, s3, s4, . . . . , sN)
You have to find a function f(t) = a*t+b such that the Euclidean Distance between 
the given sequence and the function values where t varies from 1 to N is minimum.

In effect, you have to minimize



Output the values a and b for each test case, rounded up to 4 decimal places.

Input

Line 1: T /* Number of test cases T <= 1000 */
Line 2: N /* Number of values in first test case N <= 10000 */
Line 3: s1 s2 s3 s4 â€¦ sN /* all values are less than 10000 and integers */
.
.
.

Output

a b  /* Output the values a and b rounded up to 4 decimal places for each test case */

Example

Input:
3
3
1 1 1
3
1 2 3
3
1 3 1

Output:
0.0000 1.0000
1.0000 0.0000
0.0000 1.6667
