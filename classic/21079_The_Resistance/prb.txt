21079. The Resistance

Problem code: RESSTNCE



A resistor is a passive two-terminal electrical component that implements electrical resistance as a circuit element. Resistors act to reduce current flow, and, at the same time, act to lower voltage levels within circuits. When multiple resistors are connected to each other in a circuit, the net resistance depends on how they are connected. The total resistance of resistors connected in series is the sum of their individual resistance values.

 R_\mathrm{eq} = R_1  + R_2 + \cdots + R_n. 

The total resistance of resistors connected in parallel is the reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocals of the individual resistors.

 \frac{1}{R_\mathrm{eq}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \cdots +  \frac{1}{R_n}. 

In this problem, we are constructing a long network of resistors composed of N blocks. Every block has two 1 ohm resistors, shown below by the upper-left figure. We would like for you to measure the net resistance across the two leftmost terminals in a circuit with N blocks. If the circuit has one block (N=1), then the net resistance across the leftmost terminals is 1 ohm, because the horizontal resistor is not in a path connecting the leftmost terminals. Similarly, for a circuit with two blocks (N=2), the net resistance is 2/3 ohms. The figures below illustrate this.



Find the resistance A/B of the circuit composed of N blocks. Since these values can be enormous, reduce the fraction A/B to lowest terms P/Q (i.e., gcd(P,Q) = 1), and then print (P mod M)/(Q mod M), where M is the given modulus.

Input

The first line contains T test cases. Each of the next T lines contains two integers N and M.

Output

For each test case, print on its own line the numerator and denominator of the net resistance across the leftmost terminals in lowest terms modulo M, seperated by only the '/' character.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ N ≤ 106
1 ≤ M ≤ 109

Analysis:
    if you calculate few terms they will be of the form

1/1 2/3 5/8 13/21 .... it fibonacci series

n term is like fib(2n-1)/fib(2n)

gcd(fib(n-1), fib(n)) = 1

just do fib(2n) using

|1 1| power 2n-1 , fib(2n) = A[0][0], fib(2n-1) = A[0][1] 
|1 0|
