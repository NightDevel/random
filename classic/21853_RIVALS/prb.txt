SPOJ Problem Set (classical)

21853. Rivals

Problem code: RIVALS

 

Mohamed Yasser (AKA Abo-3obaida) and Mohamed Ahmed (AKA Nesr) pretend to be rivals, the two clearly have a deep and understanding friendship. One day they imagine that the city is a 2D plane with Cartesian coordinate system, the two rivals are located in point (0,0), and they are targeting point (X,Y). They can make two moves only: 1) move right to point (x + 1, y). 2) move up to point (x, y + 1). Nesr immediately said: "I've figured out how many ways are there to reach our target". Abo-3obaida replied: "I'll not lose this challenge". Could you help Abo-3obaida to figure out how many ways to the target?! Since the required number may be very large, find its remainder of division by 1000000007 (109+7).

Could you help Abo-3obaida to figure out how many ways to the target?!

Since the required number may be very large, find its remainder of division by 1000000007 (109 + 7).

Input

The first line of input contains an integer T (1 <= T <= 1000) followed by T test cases.

Each case contains two space-separated integers  X,  Y (0 <= X, Y <= 106).

Output

For each test case, print a single integer the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).

Example

Input:
3
1 3
2 4
5 3

Output:
4
15
56

:
C(m+n, n)
(m+n)!/(m! * n!)
