21690. Power the Power Up

Problem code: POWERUP


Your younger brother's teacher gave him this simple problem.

Given b and c. Evaluate the result of this expression:

Result1 = bc

Your brother definitely was able to solve this easy problem. So his teacher decided to give him a bit harder problem.

Given a,b and c. Evaluate the result of this expression:

Result1 = bc

Result2 = aResult1

However, your brother was also able to solve it. It was not that harder. His teacher was excited -though- and gave him this Bonus Programming Assignment.

Write a program that is given a,b and c; calculates the value of Result2. Since the output may be exponentially very large, checking the correctness of solutions will be a bit subtle problem. So, instead of printing the whole value of Result2, just print the reaminder of dividing Result2 by 1,000,000,007 (109 + 7).

Can you help him solve that task?

Input

The input consists of several test cases. Each case is on a single line. In each case, given three space separated integers a,b and c (0 <=a, b, c <= 231 - 1). The input is terminated by a = b = c =  - 1

Output

For each case, print exactly one line containing the value of Result2 modulus 109 + 7

Analysis:
==========
a^(b^c) % p ;
let say b^c = d

a^d % p = a^(d%p-1) % p ; due to fermat's little theorem i.e a^p-1 = 1 (mod p)

1. solve b^c % (p-1) first = d
2. solve a^d % p
