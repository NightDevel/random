Tips n Tricks:
=============
- If "int main" is give eg: "main" then default function prototype is int and return value is 0"
- Do not include stdio.h will reduce the code
- Reuse global variables as much as possible
- Renames variables and functions to single alphabets
- Global variables if not explicitly defined are implicitly defined to be "int"
- Use macros to replace repeated statements eg: while(....) can be replaced with 
#define w while(
- assiging values to variables
  say we have declare a local variable inside a function, typically it takes 
  int a=20; 9 characters

  func(a)
  {
  }

  main()
  {
   func(20)
  }
  this way: 3 characters
- push statments into loops as much as  possible as it reduces the two {} 
  
  while (1) {
        scanf("%d", &a);
        if (!a)
            break;
 }
  can be written as 
  while(scanf("%d", &a), a);

- removing multiple assignment statements
    n=n+1;
    g = n + t;
    g = n+++t;

- multiply 
    d=a>b?c:0 
    d=(a>b)*c

-use pointer increment for array's
    *g++=10

- Replace for with while reduces ";"
    for(t=10; t>0;t--)
    t=10
    while(--t)

- Use +=,%=,/= to further reduce code.
