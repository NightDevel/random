Problem code: DIGCNT



Given two integers a and b, we write the numbers between a and b, inclusive,in a list. Your task is to calculate the number of occurrences of each digit except zeroFor example, if a = 1024 and b = 1032, the list will be 1024 1025 1026 1027 1028 1029 1030 1031 1032there are ten 1s, seven 2s, three 3s, and etc..Given two integers a and b, we write the numbers between a and b, inclusive,

The input consists of up to 500 lines. Each line contains two numbers a and b
where 1 <= a, b <= 10^16. The input is terminated by a line 0 0.  

                                                                                       Output
For each pair of input, output a line containing ten numbers separated
by single spaces. The first number is the number of occurrences of the digit 1,
the second is the number of occurrences of the digit 2, etc..

                                                                                      Example

input
1 10
0 0 

output
2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
