12933. n-divisors

Problem code: NDIV



we all know about prime numbers, prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself .

we can Classify the numbers by its number of divisors, as n-divisors-numbers, for example number 1 is 1-divisor number, number 4 is 3-divisors-number... ect .

Note: all prime numbers are 2-divisors numbers.

example :
8 is a 4-divisors-number [1,2,4,8].

Input

three integers a, b, n.

Output

print single line the number of n-divisors numbers between a and b inclusive.


Example

Input:
1 7 2
Output:
4

constraints

1 <= a,b<=10^9
0 <=b - a <= 10^4 .
1<= n <= 100


Analysis:
steps:
find all primes sqrt(1000000000): upto 32000

for i in [a,b]
do the following

find all factors of a

possible factors = a1^p1 * a2^p2 a3^p3 
result = (p1+1)(p2+2)(p2+3) 
while checking for all factors which divide a, 
count the number of times each prime will divide a. then reduce a, then recaculate the max 
prime that can divide remaining a.
