21332. Pigeonhole Tower

Problem code: PHT


 

Pigeon SSNA want to build a tower with some wood walls. Let's describe the tower they want to make:

A Tower can consist of different number of level.
If a tower contain L levels then 1st level must contain L  holes , 2nd level L-1 , 3rd level L-2 ….. L level contain 1 hole .
Each room contain 3 wood walls.
See the picture below:

 

                                 3 level                    4level

                                           3 Level Tower                                      4 Level tower

 

Now pigeon SSNA has n wood walls. What is maximum number of level he can made.  

 

Input

Input starts with an integer T (≤ 100000), denoting the number of test cases.

Each case starts with a line containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1012)

 

Output

For each case of input you have to print the case number and expected answer.

Sample Input

Case 1: 3

Case 2: 4

analysis:
layer l required 2*l-1 sticks

so sum of first l odd numbers = (l)^2 
1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ... , 2*l-1

but we should not add 1 (becoz first valid tower has 3 sticks): (l*l)/4 - 1

l^2/4 - 1 = p => l = sqrt(4 * (p+1)) = 2 * sqrt(p+1)
now l = total terms i.e like 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12 here there are 6 odd term n 6 even terms
what we get here is l = 12, l/2 = 6 is the total odd terms.

so sqrt(p+1) is the total tower level, 1 is not there so 
sqrt(p+1)-1 is the answer
